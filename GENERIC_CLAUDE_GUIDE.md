# Note about CLAUDE.md Files

There are TWO CLAUDE.md files in this setup:

1. **Generic Guide** (~/Developer/CLAUDE.md)
   - General guidelines for ALL projects in the Developer directory
   - Contains generic workflow rules
   - Not specific to any project

2. **Project-Specific Guide** (~/Developer/fast-intercom-mcp/CLAUDE.md) 
   - THIS is the one Claude uses when working on FastIntercom MCP
   - Contains project-specific commands, paths, and workflows
   - Always run Claude from the project directory to use this guide

**Best Practice**: Always run Claude from the specific project directory you're working on, not from the parent Developer directory.
